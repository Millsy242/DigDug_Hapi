# DigDug_Hapi
DigDug recreated using the Hapi_Start framework

Hapi_Start created by K.Ditchburn (not me) for Teesside University 

These are the exact files handed in to Teesside University, Computer Games Programming (BSC), Second Year - Games Engine Construction module.  It achieved a mark of 84% 

The task was to create a 2d graphics engine using Hapi, implementing drawing to the screen, sprite loading etc. Then to use this to create a 2d game to show off the 'engine' 

Please note: this does not contain any changes I have made after the handin in January 2018. 

Also dont use this to copy and use in University work, its a bad idea and doesnt teach you anything
